Nette Sandbox
=============

This is a simple pre-packaged and pre-configured application using the [Nette](https://nette.org)
that you can use as the starting point for your new applications.

[Nette](https://nette.org) is a popular tool for PHP web development.
It is designed to be the most usable and friendliest as possible. It focuses
on security and performance and is definitely one of the safest PHP frameworks.

Installation
------------

The best way to install Web Project is using Composer. If you don't have Composer yet,
download it following [the instructions](https://doc.nette.org/composer). Then use command:

	composer create-project nette/sandbox path/to/install
	cd path/to/install


Make directories `temp/` and `log/` writable.


Web Server Setup
----------------

The simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:

	php -S localhost:8000 -t www

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the welcome page.

For Apache or Nginx, setup a virtual host to point to the `www/` directory of the project and you
should be ready to go.

It is CRITICAL that whole `app/`, `log/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly
via a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).


Requirements
------------

- Sandbox for Nette 3.0 requires PHP 7.1

To check whether server configuration meets the minimum requirements for
Nette Framework browse to the directory `/checker` in your project root (i.e. `http://localhost:8000/checker`).


Adminer
-------

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is full-featured database management tool written in PHP and it is part of this Sandbox.
To use it, browse to the subdirectory `/adminer` in your project root (i.e. `http://localhost:8000/adminer`).


Notice: Composer PHP version
----------------------------

This project forces PHP 5.6 (eventually 7.1) as your PHP version for Composer packages. If you have newer
version on production server you should change it in `composer.json`:

```json
"config": {
	"platform": {
		"php": "7.2"
	}
}
```
